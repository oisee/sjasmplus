== implementation notes:

=== supported record block types:
- block 00 Data
- block 01 End of file
- block 03 start segment address
  - no idea if this is compatible with Z80 machines, but it's provided in *some* way
- everything else seems out of scope, especially as I don't plan banking support initially
- in case of banking I guess block 04 may be of interest

=== directives syntax
; HEXOUT <hex filename>
; HEXEND <start_address>    ; this affects also the global "start address" state (directive `END`)
; HEXEND -1                 ; explicit start address OFF

=== implementation specifics/peculiarities
; - only one HEX ouput can be active at time, ie. --hex vs HEXOUT vs SAVEHEX -> all collide together
; - no SIZE support for --hex and HEXOUT (doesn't seem to make sense with HEX containing records with addresses)
; - obviously no FPOS and append/rewind, HEX is not binary file but text file with formatting
; - no support for banks/longptr at this moment, open github issue if you have real use case for that
; `HEXEND` will finish also --hex started output
; `<end of source>` will finish also last HEXOUT started output

=== things to test in directive tests to test this thoroughly:
; - syntax errors of HEXOUT (and all errors added through code)
; - DEVICE + SAVEHEX combination
;   - (maybe not possible together with HEXOUT because of buffer? or collecting buffer vs device mem for lower level fn.)
; - test HEXOUT implicit close by EOF
